\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}

The goal in this work is the detection of cell boundaries from electron microscopy images. Given are 30 labeled training images which should used to train a random forest.
To validate the performance of the implementation cross-validation should be done.
After training an image it should be processed by a sliding window which is move over the image and pushed through the trees.
Furthermore OpenCV for image processing and OpenMP for parallization should be used. CMake was used to be compatible with different platform architectures.
